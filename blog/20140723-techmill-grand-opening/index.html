While we are shy of our campaign’s funding goal, we’re forging a path forward using the bootstrap methodology we started with. Now that we have an accurate measurement of the community’s needs and appetite, we can build the co-working space you&nbsp;want!</p><p>On <a href="http://www.meetup.com/StartupDentonTech/events/196680522/">Friday, August 8<span class=ord>th</span></a>, we will celebrate the grand opening of TechMill: Denton’s first co-working community, located right in the heart of the spot that made our very existence possible: <a href="http://dentonbanter.com/">Banter</a>!</p><p>TechMill will be a very unique kind of co-working space, offering shared working tables that are integrated directly into the community. These tables will be completely open for anyone to use for <strong><span class=caps>FREE</span></strong>.</p><p>We will also offer memberships with amenities at an extremely low cost: $50/month or $5/ day gets&nbsp;you:</p><ul><li>Free coffee and&nbsp;tea</li><li>10% discount on food and espresso at&nbsp;Banter</li><li>Priority seating on shared&nbsp;tables</li><li>Access to a locking cabinet for storing equipment when out during the&nbsp;day</li></ul><p>Our tables will be located at the very front of Banter, and accommodate 6-8 people each. Each table will also have a power hub, so no one has to go fishing for power! We have also helped Banter accommodate a larger network load by upgrading the WiFi&nbsp;network.</p><p><a href="http://www.meetup.com/StartupDentonTech/events/196680522/">Come join us</a> at Banter Friday, August 8<span class=ord>th</span>, at 6:<span class=caps>30PM</span>, check out Denton’s new co-working space, and share drinks with our founders and members!
