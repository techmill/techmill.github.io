In the first week since our campaign launched, we’ve already reached 13% of our total funding goal — a huge milestone. That’s <strong>phenomenal</strong>!</p><p>To cap this off, the day after our campaign launched, <a href="http://grovedallas.com/">The Grove</a> also launched <a href=http://bit.ly/grovegrow>their Indiegogo campaign</a> to expand their space in Dallas, due to unprecedented&nbsp;growth!</p><p>Late last week, I had the pleasure of talking with <a href=https://twitter.com/jnyg>Justin Nygren</a>, co-owner of The Grove, about the spirit of collaboration and resource sharing in the <span class=caps>DFW</span> startup community. Justin proposed that we show solidarity by donating to each other’s campaigns today. In support of Justin’s proposal, TechMill will be contributing directly to the Grove’s expansion&nbsp;campaign.</p><p>On top of this, Justin and I are asking all members of both the Grove, and future members of Cowork Denton, to donate directly to each others campaigns. As Justin likes to say, “This is the new&nbsp;economy.”</p><p>The common threads we share with the Dallas startup community are too numerous to list here, but this is our region’s attempt to lead by example. Let’s show the rest of the state how our metroplex values collaboration over competition, and community over&nbsp;selfishness.</p></div></div><div class=row><div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2"><h1 class=centered>TechMill's Grand Opening at Banter</h1><p class=author><img src=/image/team/marshall.jpg width=40px class="author-image img img-circle"><span class=author><a href=mailto:marshall.law@gmail.com>marshall</a></span> on July 23, 2014</p><p class=article></p><p>We’ve been humbled by the outpouring of love and support from our North Texas startup&nbsp;community.</p><p>Since we began this journey, we’ve promoted the philosophy of bootstrapping. <a href=http://igg.me/at/cowork-denton>Our IndieGoGo campaign</a> was our way of carefully measuring community need to better understand the type of co-working space Denton wants. While we are shy of our campaign’s funding goal, we’re forging a path forward using the bootstrap methodology we started with. Now that we have an accurate measurement of the community’s needs and appetite, we can build the co-working space you&nbsp;want!</p><p>On <a href="http://www.meetup.com/StartupDentonTech/events/196680522/">Friday, August 8<span class=ord>th</span></a>, we will celebrate the grand opening of TechMill: Denton’s first co-working community, located right in the heart of the spot that made our very existence possible: <a href="http://dentonbanter.com/">Banter</a>!</p><p>TechMill will be a very unique kind of co-working space, offering shared working tables that are integrated directly into the community. These tables will be completely open for anyone to use for <strong><span class=caps>FREE</span></strong>.</p><p>We will also offer memberships with amenities at an extremely low cost: $50/month or $5/ day gets&nbsp;you:</p><ul><li>Free coffee and&nbsp;tea</li><li>10% discount on food and espresso at&nbsp;Banter</li><li>Priority seating on shared&nbsp;tables</li><li>Access to a locking cabinet for storing equipment when out during the&nbsp;day</li></ul><p>Our tables will be located at the very front of Banter, and accommodate 6-8 people each. Each table will also have a power hub, so no one has to go fishing for power! We have also helped Banter accommodate a larger network load by upgrading the WiFi&nbsp;network.</p><p><a href="http://www.meetup.com/StartupDentonTech/events/196680522/">Come join us</a> at Banter Friday, August 8<span class=ord>th</span>, at 6:<span class=caps>30PM</span>, check out Denton’s new co-working space, and share drinks with our founders and members!
