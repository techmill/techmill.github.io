The source code lives in the 'source' branch, and 'master' is used for deployment
with Github pages.

To setup the dev environment:

    $ ./setup.sh

To run the dev preview server on port 9000:

    $ grunt preview

To build and publish (don't forget to push your changes to the source branch!)

    $ grunt deploy
