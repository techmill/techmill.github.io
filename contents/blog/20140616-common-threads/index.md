I'm awe struck by the growth, collaboration, and comradery shown by the
Denton and wider DFW startup community lately.

Last week, we publicly [launched TechMill][launch], an
[Indiegogo campaign for Cowork Denton][cowork-denton],
and announced our first startup conference for Denton: BootConf.
In the first week since our campaign launched, we've already reached 13% of our total funding goal -- a huge
milestone. That's **phenomenal**!

To cap this off, the day after our campaign launched, [The Grove][grove] also
launched [their Indiegogo campaign][grovegrow] to expand their space in Dallas,
due to unprecedented growth!

Late last week, I had the pleasure of talking with [Justin Nygren][jnygren],
co-owner of The Grove, about the spirit of collaboration and resource sharing
in the DFW startup community. Justin proposed that we show solidarity by donating
to each other's campaigns today. In support of Justin's proposal, TechMill will
be contributing directly to the Grove's expansion campaign.

On top of this, Justin and I are asking all members of both the Grove, and future
members of Cowork Denton, to donate directly to each others campaigns. As Justin
likes to say, "This is the new economy."

The common threads we share with the Dallas startup community are too numerous
to list here, but this is our region's attempt to lead by example. Let's show
the rest of the state how our metroplex values collaboration over competition,
and community over selfishness.
