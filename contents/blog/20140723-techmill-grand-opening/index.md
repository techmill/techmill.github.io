We've been humbled by the outpouring of love and support from our North Texas
startup community.

Since we began this journey, we’ve promoted the philosophy of bootstrapping.
[Our IndieGoGo campaign][campaign] was our way of carefully measuring community
need to better understand the type of co-working space Denton wants.  While we
are shy of our campaign's funding goal, we're forging a path forward using the
bootstrap methodology we started with.  Now that we have an accurate measurement
of the community’s needs and appetite, we can build the co-working space you want!

On [Friday, August 8th][event-link], we will celebrate the grand opening of
TechMill: Denton's first co-working community, located right in the heart of
the spot that made our very existence possible: [Banter][banter]!

TechMill will be a very unique kind of co-working space, offering shared working
tables that are integrated directly into the community. These tables will be
completely open for anyone to use for **FREE**.

We will also offer memberships with amenities at an extremely low cost: $50/month or $5/ day gets you:
- Free coffee and tea
- 10% discount on food and espresso at Banter
- Priority seating on shared tables
- Access to a locking cabinet for storing equipment when out during the day

Our tables will be located at the very front of Banter, and accommodate 6-8
people each. Each table will also have a power hub, so no one has to go fishing
for power! We have also helped Banter accommodate a larger network load by
upgrading the WiFi network.

[Come join us][event-link] at Banter Friday, August 8th, at 6:30PM, check out
Denton’s new co-working space, and share drinks with our founders and members!
Let’s party!
